# Halite2
A bot for Halite II written in Java.

I used the Java starter pack provided by Two Sigma.

First, starting with the bot in the starter pack, I developed several versions of what I called QueueBot.  Then, I rewrote my bot from scratch, calling it MatrixBot.  MyBot.java represents the latest version (the version that is in the finals); I call it MatrixBot9.
